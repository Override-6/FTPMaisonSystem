## Connected Objects
* Give up automatic object connection - Why not making a new kind of Constructor ? a ConnectCondtructor ? or maybe reuse the `New` sync instance creator
* why not making a compiled JVM language for the contracts ? this can be fun to make and bring a lot of optimisation and possibilities for contract descriptions

## Persistence
* inline prilitives instead of storing them in respective PoolChunk

## Misc
* Support Ability to move a client's connection between servers of a cluster easily, the GNOM's state of the client and the new server will need to sync
* In correlation with the above point, be able to connect to multiple servers at once.
* SUPPORT SSL / SECURE CONNECTIONS !!
* Use scala 3 ?
