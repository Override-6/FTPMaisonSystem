* Synchronized/Shared cache : 
   - Extendable and easy to use shared cache system.
   - Simple shared caches             : Shared Collection, Shared Map, Shared Instances
   - More complex and powerful caches : Synchronized objects, (like CORBA) but more powerful because any kind of object can be synchronized without writing piece of code.
