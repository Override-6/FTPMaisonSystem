![Cover](RCover.png)

Linkit is a framework that handles the network side of an application, allowing it to share objects between the server
and its clients. Shared objects can be converted into "Connected Objects"
in which method calls can be triggered according to a defined contract amongst actual and distant versions of the
connected object. This special handling is available for instances of any public / non-final classes.
