![Cover](RCover.png)
 A Framework to easily synchronise and link (remote) JVM processes between them.  

The Linkit framework is a framework that handles the network side of an application,  
allowing it to share objects between the server and its clients. 
Shared objects can receive a special handling which gives the possibility to replicate method calls onto the distant versions of the object, 
following an object contract. This special handling is available on instances of any public / non-final classes.
